# Project Overview
The Attendance Management System is designed with scalability and code reusability in mind. This means that the same project can be altered by changing a few variables to get the desired results. Furthermore, there's scope for adding more functionality without disturbing any of the existing features. This is made possible by using Object-Oriented Programming, a modular design for web services, and following large parts of the MVC model. This approach allows us to extend the project to mobile applications and other environments.

# Features
  Automated attendance recording
  User roles for teachers, students, and administrators
  Scalable and reusable codebase
  Modular design for easy functionality extension
  Follows MVC architecture for better maintainability
  Potential for mobile application integration

# Technologies Used
The Attendance Management System leverages a variety of technologies to ensure a robust, scalable, and maintainable application. Here's an overview of the technologies used:
 # Frontend
    HTML: Used for structuring the web pages.
    CSS: Utilized for styling and making the application visually appealing.
    JavaScript: Implements dynamic behaviors and enhances user interaction on the frontend.
 # Backend
    PHP: Serves as the server-side scripting language, handling business logic and database interactions.
    PHPMyAdmin: A web-based interface used for managing the MySQL database efficiently.
 # Database
    MySQL: Stores all the data related to attendance, users, and roles.
 # Architecture
    MVC (Model-View-Controller): Ensures better maintainability and separation of concerns within the codebase.
 # Additional Features
    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Facilitates code reusability and scalability by structuring the application into objects.
    Modular Design: Allows easy addition of new functionalities without disrupting existing features, making the system extensible to other platforms such as mobile     applications.
